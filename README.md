# Predicting-Student-Adaptability-Levels-in-Online-Education
Predict the outcome of Student's Adaptability Level Prediction in Online Education using Machine Learning Approaches

Project Overview:

In 2019, when the big virus hit and many places closed down, schools were not spared. People had to find new ways to teach and learn, and one popular solution was online education. This data we're looking at is from Bangladesh, and it's crucial because it helps us understand online learning better. It's not just about students; even grown-ups had to learn new things on their computers. Policymakers and important people need to know this stuff to make good decisions.

The purpose of this project is to utilize supervised machine learning methods to develop a model that can predict the level of student adaptability based on various demographic and socioeconomic features. Through the assessment of the predictive model, we can determine which factors impact/contribute to student adaptability in online learning with a goal of using this information to tailor programs and improve outcomes for new digital learners.
